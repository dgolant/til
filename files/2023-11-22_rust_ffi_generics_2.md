TIL more about generics, enums, and Rust FFI

In extern(C) functions, enums are not supported because.. Rust-style enums with fields don't exist in C! There may be ways to define bridges between C-style enums and Rust, but the utility of this is diminished in C, where you don't have many of the enum-related evaluations (like Some()) that make enums great in Rust.

Relatedly, generics in the FFI boundary _can_ be supported, but only if you fully specify the possible values of the generics in the header generated by cbindgen (or created by hand). Without full specification of possible generic values, the compiler cannot "monomorphize" the essentially polymorphic function you're handing it, because the output is potentially unbounded.
